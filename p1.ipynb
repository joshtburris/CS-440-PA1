    "Consider a system that contains $n$ units labeled $\\{0,\\ldots,n-1\\}$ that are all connected.  Each unit has a state associated with it, where unit $i$ has a state $x_i$, and the overall state is referred to as $\\mathbf{x}$, i.e. $\\mathbf{x} = \\{x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{n-1}\\}$.  Assume that $x_i$ takes on the values -1 or +1.  All the units are interconnected and the weight of the connection between units $i$ and $j$ is given by $w_{ij}$.  We assume that the connectivity matrix is symmetric, i.e. $w_{ij} = w_{ji}$.  The state of the system is associated with a cost function, also referred to as energy, given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "We are interested in finding the global minimum of $E(\\mathbf{x})$, i.e. to find $\\mathbf{x}^*$ such that $E(\\mathbf{x}^*) \\leq E(\\mathbf{x})$ for all choices of $\\mathbf{x}$, and return the value of $E(\\mathbf{x}^*)$.\n",
    "The problem of finding this global minimum is NP-complete, i.e. there is no known efficient algorithm for computing it.  Therefore, you will need to consider all possible assignments to the variables $x_i$ when searching for the global minimum of $E(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",
